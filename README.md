# CRUD-operation-using-mongoDB-node
This is a simple server application using node.js. Here I have created services for popular Angular 2 [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) tutorial.
In this example you will see REST services to perform basic CRUD operations. I have used Mongodb as database.

## Connect your node script with MongoDB
## Create a collection named “Tasks”
## Add 4 documents (tasks) in the collection with fields Description – A string and Completed – true or false -> Create
## Read all the documents (tasks) which are not completed (Completed: false) and log them on the terminal -> Read
## Update the documents (tasks) which are not completed as completed i.e. (Completed: false -> true)-> Update
## Delete a document (task) using it’s ID -> Delete
